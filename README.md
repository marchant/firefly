Firefly
=======

Firefly parallels the Beacon ne√© Lumieres project as another host for the 
Filament application.

Firefly will serve Filament itself for use inside a browser and also provide
services access to services for consumption in Filament much like Beacon does
through its associated Environment Bridge.
